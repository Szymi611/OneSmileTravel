## Application Walkthrough

### Login and Registration
The first screen users encounter is the login screen, with an option to navigate to the registration screen. For user authentication, we used Firebase, which will be discussed in more detail later.

### Country Selection
Upon logging in or creating an account, users are presented with a screen displaying flags of European countries, powered by an API. This feature allows users to mark countries they have visited.

### Notes
The next screen allows users to add or edit notes. This feature is intended to store memories of past travels and plans for future trips, but it can be used for any notes.

### Chat Functionality
The final screen enables users to create new chats visible to all users or join existing ones. The main idea is to facilitate meetings with other travelers or locals in the same city, making group arrangements easier.

## Technologies Used

### API Integration
For country flags and names, we used an API.

### What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of defined rules and protocols that allows applications to communicate with each other. It acts as a bridge, enabling data and functionality exchange between different programs. This is a crucial tool in today's tech world, allowing various systems to work together.

### How Does It Work?
An API operates on a request-response mechanism: one application sends a request, and another provides a response. This allows for orderly and efficient information exchange between applications.

### Applications
APIs are widely used for integrating different systems, creating mobile apps, building user interfaces, and accessing external services and data. They accelerate project development and enhance functionality by allowing the use of features from other applications.

### Firebase Integration
Another significant technology we used is Firebase, a comprehensive platform offering various services for developing mobile and web applications. One key feature is the Firebase Realtime Database, which allows live data storage and synchronization.

### Firebase Realtime Database
This database enables data synchronization across multiple devices. Any changes are instantly visible on all connected devices, making it ideal for applications requiring real-time data updates.

### Integration
Firebase is accessible across multiple platforms, making it easy to integrate with mobile applications. It offers services such as user authentication (used in our app), data analytics, file storage, and more, making it a powerful tool for developers to create modern applications quickly and efficiently.

### Chat Functionality with Firebase
In our project, one application of the Firebase Realtime Database is our chat feature. This ensures that messages sent in the chat are instantly visible to all users, providing smooth and seamless communication.
